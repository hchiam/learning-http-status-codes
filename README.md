# Learning HTTP status codes

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

- 100+ = **info**
- 200+ = **success**
- 300+ = **redirect**
- 400+ = **client** error ("it's you")
- 500+ = **server** error ("it's not you user, it's me")

## Rhyming mnemonics:

(For better mental portability.)

1. **One bun** with a nutritional **_info_** label on the packaging.
2. **Two shoes** of a **_successful_** athelete (lucky shoes).
3. **Three trees** with **_redirecting_** branches/roots which reroute water.
4. **Four doors**. Your four entry doors (for **_clients_**) are broken. Or maybe you're not authorized to open the doors.
5. **Five hives**. We have error bees buzzing inside your **_database_** hives.

## All-in-one story mnemonic:

Imagine a _**successful**_ basketball player with Michael Jordan _shoes_, taking a Vietnamese _bun_ nutrition _**information**_ label (that has the unusual inclusion of honey as an ingredient), to the _**front**_ _door_ of a bee keeper's house, to go find the bee _hive_ _**inside**_ the house (or if it's not there, you might get _**redirected**_ to a _tree_ to find the treehouse that actually contains the bee hive).
